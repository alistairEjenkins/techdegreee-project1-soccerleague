Dear Wynonna Brown,
    I am writing to welcome Les Clay as a member of the Dragons soccer team. 

Our first practice will be held at the big field 12.00 on 8/28. Please 
contact me if Les Clay is unable to attend or running late, and ensure
they have their soccer boots with them.

If you have any other queries, please give me a call or drop me
an e-mail.

Thank you for all your support,
Go Dragons!
