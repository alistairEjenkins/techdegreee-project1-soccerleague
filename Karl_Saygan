Dear Heather Bledsoe,
    I am writing to welcome Karl Saygan as a member of the Raptors soccer team. 

Our first practice will be held at the big field 14.30 on 27/8. Please 
contact me if Karl Saygan is unable to attend or running late, and ensure
they have their soccer boots with them.

If you have any other queries, please give me a call or drop me
an e-mail.

Thank you for all your support,
Go Raptors!
