Dear Wendy and Mike Gordon,
    I am writing to welcome Eva Gordon as a member of the Sharks soccer team. 

Our first practice will be held at the big field 15.00 on 9/1. Please 
contact me if Eva Gordon is unable to attend or running late, and ensure
they have their soccer boots with them.

If you have any other queries, please give me a call or drop me
an e-mail.

Thank you for all your support,
Go Sharks!
